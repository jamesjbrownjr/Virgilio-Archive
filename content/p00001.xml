I used 'circle' and 'star', but you might want to change that. I'm also working under the assumption that all starred line groups are also circled, so you might want to review the archives to see if you want a third option for 'circle/star'. Also note that I did not include 'subtype' for entries that were not circled - you might choose to add that with a value of 'null' or something. -->
